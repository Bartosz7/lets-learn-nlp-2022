    "Before starting this workshop, here is a list of necessary requirements:\n",
    "*   Access to a **PC** or **laptop** (**1** per student/group)\n",
    "*   **Python** **3.9** or higher installed on the computer\n",
    "*   **Jupyter** **notebook** package installed (**Helpful guide**: https://jupyter.org/install)\n",
    "*   Have our **virtual** **environment** activated. It will include all the important dependencies needed to run the notebook.\n",
    "*   We recommend the students have some basic knowledge about **programming in Python**, however, many of the exercises will involve running simple commands and we have done our best to abstract any complicated logic away.\n",
    "* There will be some use of **maths** to explain how words are stored. We recommend students have some knowledge of **vectors** and how they are added together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives (rewrite this section)\n",
    "\n",
    "During this workshop you will:\n",
    "1. Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "2. Understand the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing methods\n",
    "3. Improve your  programming skills and learn the basics of **spacy** library\n",
    "4. Use the acquired knowledge and skills in practice and apply them in simple NLP exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon finishing the workshop, you should be able to answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. What is NLP? What domains is it used in and how?\n",
    "2. What are some of the basic tools and processes of text analysis?\n",
    "3. How computers represent and interpret human-written text?\n",
    "4. How sentiment analysis works? (the basics)\n",
    "5. What are some of the methods of extracting keywords or performing text summarization?"

    "NLP is used throughout our daily lives. When we talk to a virtual assistant such as *Alexa* or *Siri*, they are using NLP tools to process what we said and then provide a response in their voice. If you want to translate text from one language into another, NLP is used here. It is also used for correcting grammar and spelling mistakes, like *Microsoft Word* or *Grammarly* does.\n",
